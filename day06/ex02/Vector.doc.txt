<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class allows you to do some operations with vectors.

It operates with Vertex class, so to create a vector, you need to pass the next
parameters:

'dest' - the vectors destination vertex (mandatory);
'orig' - the vector’s origin vertex (optional);

The syntax is:
	$new_vector = new Vector(array( 'orig' => $orig, 'dest' => $dest ) );

If orig doesn't exist, its default value is vertex with (x=0, y=0, z=0, w=1).

The Vertex class parameters ('x', 'y', 'z' and 'w') are private
and can be read using accessors (getX(), getY(), getZ(), getW()).
Created vector couldn't be modified.

Useful methods to operate with your vectors:

- float magnitude() : returns the vector’s length (or "norm");
- Vector normalize() : returns a normalized version of the vector. If the vector is
  already normalized, returns a fresh copy of the vector;
- Vector add( Vector $rhs ) : returns the sum vector of both vectors;
- Vector sub( Vector $rhs ) : returns the difference vector of both vectors;
- Vector opposite() : returns the opposite vector;
- Vector scalarProduct( $k ) : returns the multiplication of the vector with a scalar;
- float dotProduct( Vector $rhs ) : returns the scalar multiplication of both vectors;
- float cos( Vector $rhs ) : returns the angle’sAppendix cosine between both vectors;
- Vector crossProduct( Vector $rhs ) : returns the cross multiplication of both vectors.
